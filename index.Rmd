I am a PhD candidate at Michigan State University in the department of communicative science and disorders. I am a person who stutters and a Speech-Language Pathologist. I am actively involved with various support organizations for people who stutter, national and international stuttering organizations, and practice clinically. I live in Lansing, Michigan with my wife (Allison) and our puppy (Charlie).
